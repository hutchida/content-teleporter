This meant the individual being sued was never on the hook as guarantor because one of the intended guarantors had not signed the document (his signature had been forged). The guarantee was a single composite document, which sought to impose joint and several liability on four individuals together defined as &#8216;the Guarantor&#8217; and envisaged it would be signed by all four individuals. There was nothing in the wording excluding the result that all intended guarantors had to sign for an individual guarantor to be liable. It is assumed that the contract into which this clause is inserted provides for joint and several liability where obligations are owed by more than one party. This sub-clause is an attempt to avoid the problem in <em class='it'>Harvey</em> as whilst the case relates to a bank guarantee it could, of course, be of wider application in the context of guarantees.

The 2011 version of the Code contains an undertaking by the seller&#8217;s solicitor that it has the seller&#8217;s authority to receive the purchase money on completion (and the same undertaking is re-stated in the 2019 version of the Code). The Court of Appeal interpreted &#8216;completion&#8217; to mean a real completion in which real money is exchanged for the title to the land and on that basis a completion with a fraudster is no completion at all. </p></div><div><p>Accordingly, by using the Code, the seller&#8217;s solicitor gives an undertaking that it has the authority of the real owner of the property to complete the transaction. The seller&#8217;s solicitor breaches that undertaking when they purport to complete on behalf of a fraudster impersonating the real owner. </p></div><div><p><lnb-prec:margin-note><a class='https' href='www.lawsociety.org.uk/support-services/documents/code-for-completion-by-post-2019/'>Law Society Code for Completion by Post 2019</a></lnb-prec:margin-note>The <em class='it'>Dreamvar</em> case prompted the Law Society to release an updated version of the Code in May 2019. The obligations in the 2019 Code are unchanged from those in the 2011 version, although the numbering has changed. The majority of the changes are to reinforce that the effect of the use of the Code is that the seller&#8217;s solicitor undertakes that the seller is the person genuinely entitled to sell the land. (See Practice Note: <a normcite='0OM9_45869'>How does completion happen?</a>.)</p></div><div><p>The Protocol states:</p></div><ul number-type='disc'><li><div><p>&#8216;When acting for a buyer, we will not normally request confirmation of identity, or assurances as to the carrying out of AML checks or similar, from the seller&#8217;s solicitors. Our AML responsibilities are not there to create a cause of action between law firms.</p></div></li><li><div><p>Instead we will rely on the seller&#8217;s solicitors&#8217; undertaking that they are authorised to receive the completion funds on the seller&#8217;s behalf (as the Court of Appeal held in Dreamvar that this meant the true owner). Accordingly where the Code is not being adopted, the seller&#8217;s solicitors should be prepared to undertake that they are authorised to receive the completion funds on the seller&#8217;s behalf. No well advised real estate lawyer acting for a buyer would complete without such an undertaking anyway and if completion is to be dealt with via solicitors, no seller&#8217;s solicitor could avoid giving such an undertaking in order for the completion process to proceed with confidence.</p></div></li><li><div><p>We recognise that to be sure that such an undertaking will be given before completion it will be necessary to add a contractual obligation on the seller to procure that their solicitor will provide such an undertaking (whether as part of using the Code or as a stand-alone undertaking) as a pre-condition to completion.&#8217;</p></div></li></ul><div><p>Our view is that the Protocol and LPSLG&#8217;s suggested clauses set out here as clause <a title='ukContentItem1561132277-50196260' style='color:red; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;'>xref</a> are a sensible approach to address the risk of identity fraud following <em class='it'>Dreamvar</em>. If using these clauses, the Seller&#8217;s Solicitor should note that they will entitle the Buyer to serve a notice to complete if the Undertaking is not forthcoming. The Seller&#8217;s Solicitor should also be mindful that they will be committed to providing an undertaking on Completion and therefore the firm&#8217;s internal policy regarding giving undertakings will need to be complied with.</p></div></div></div>"}]
