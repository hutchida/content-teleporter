It is common practice to sign an agreement in counterparts, and this mechanism can be particularly useful where there are a large number of parties, or where the parties are located in different regions or countries and will be unable to hold a physical completion meeting.</p></div><div><p>If an agreement does not contain a counterparts clause, the parties will not be prevented from executing a document in counterpart. However, using a counterparts clause is advisable for certainty, and to prevent any argument that the agreement is not binding because it has not been properly executed.</p></div><div><p>The counterparts clause commonly consists of:</p></div><ul number-type='disc'><li><div><p>a statement that the document may be executed in counterparts, and that each signed counterpart is to be treated as an original, and</p></div></li><li><div><p>a sub-clause dealing with virtual signing (ie circulating the signature pages by email)</p></div></li></ul><div><p>The difference between original counterparts and original duplicates should be noted here. If all the parties sign a number of copies of the agreement, each copy is an original duplicate rather than a counterpart, and the counterparts clause will not be applicable.</p></div><div><p><em class='bf'>Key legal issues</em></p></div><div><p><lnb-prec:margin-note><a>R (on the application of Mercury Tax Group and another) v HM Revenue &amp; Customs Commissioners and others [2008] All ER (D) 129 (Nov)</a></lnb-prec:margin-note><lnb-prec:margin-note><a>Law Society Guidance: Execution of documents by virtual means</a></lnb-prec:margin-note>The <em class='it'>Mercury Tax</em> case considered the effectiveness of pre-signed signature pages and virtual signings and closings where signature pages are exchanged by email. Following this case, the Law Society issued guidance on good practice for virtual signings.</p></div><div><p>The Law Society guidance sets out three options for the virtual signing of an agreement or deed. The options are stated to be non-exhaustive, but it will be in the interests of the parties to follow them as closely as possible in order to avoid any later dispute over virtual signing.</p></div><div><p>Regardless of which option is being followed, the Law Society recommends that all parties&#8217; lawyers agree to the proposed arrangements for the virtual signing/closing well in advance of execution. For this reason, it has become common practice to include specific drafting on virtual signings in the counterparts clause (see Clause <a title='ukContentIteme0811463-9064-4103-98c0-0b67c08b9bb1' style='color:red; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;'>xref</a>).</p></div><div><p><em class='bf'>Option 1</em> gives guidance on circulating the entire document and the signed signature page by email. This method is suitable for both deeds and simple contracts (such as the Facility Agreement). The detailed requirements for option 1 are as follows:</p></div><ul number-type='disc'><li><div><p>execution copies of the documents are emailed as PDF or Word attachments to all parties that will be absent and/or their lawyers (as agreed); the signature page may be emailed as a separate PDF or Word document, for convenience</p></div></li><li><div><p>each absent signatory then prints and signs the signature page only (there is no need to print off the full document)</p></div></li><li><div><p>each absent party then returns a single email to their lawyer or to the lawyers coordinating signing/closing as agreed and attaches <em class='it'>both</em> the final version of the PDF or Word agreement and a PDF copy of the signed signature page, and</p></div></li><li><div><p>at or shortly after signing/closing, the parties may wish to evidence the execution by one of the law firms circulating a final version of the document together with copies of executed signature pages</p></div></li></ul><div><p>The Law Society guidance confirms that, for option 1, the PDF or Word final version of the document and the PDF of the signed signature page will constitute an original signed document and each counterpart taken together will equate to the same physical document.</p></div><div><p><em class='bf'>Option 2</em> allows the parties to circulate the signature page by email, without a copy of the final agreement (so is slightly less burdensome than option 1). This method is only suitable for simple contracts (not deeds). The detailed requirements for option 2 are as follows:</p></div><ul number-type='disc'><li><div><p>the final execution copies of the documents must be emailed as a PDF or Word attachement to all absent parties and/or their lawyers, as agreed; the signature page may be emailed as a separate PDF or Word document, for convenience</p></div></li><li><div><p>each absent signatory then prints and signs the signature page only (there is no need to print off the full document)</p></div></li><li><div><p>each absent party then emails its signature page as a PDF attachment to their lawyer or to the lawyers coordinating signing/closing as agreed, giving authority to attach it to the final approved version of the document, and</p></div></li><li><div><p>at or shortly after signing/closing, the parties may wish to evidence the execution by one of the law firms circulating a final version of the document together with copies of executed signature pages</p></div></li></ul><div><p>The Law Society guidance confirms that for option 2, the print-off of the final execution version of the document together with the attached signed signature pages will constitute an original signed document.</p></div><div><p><em class='bf'>Option 3</em> allows the parties to sign and circulate the signature pages in advance of finalising a document. This method is only suitable for simple contracts (not deeds). The detailed requirements for option 3 are:</p></div><ul number-type='disc'><li><div><p>enough time should be allowed to coordinate the circulation of the signature pages prior to signing/closing and each signature page should clearly identify the document to which it relates</p></div></li><li><div><p>the signature page should be executed by each of the signatories and returned to their lawyers or the law firm coordinating the signing/closing, as agreed, by email (as a PDF attachment) or by courier, to be held to the order of the signatory or their lawyers, until authority is given for it to be attached to the document to be signed, and</p></div></li><li><div><p>when each document has been finalised, the law firm coordinating the signing/closing should email the final version of the document to each absent party and/or their lawyers and obtain confirmation from them or their lawyers that they have agreed the final version of the document, and authorising the relevant law firm to attach the pre-signed signature page to the final version and to date and release the document</p></div></li></ul><div><p>The guidance confirms that the final approved version of the agreement, with the pre-signed signature pages that have been attached with the prior approval of the parties or their lawyers, will constitute an original signed document.
