# tele
This is a small hardcoded json database for users to look up uuid references to xml snippets which they can reuse in other documents. The user will search for a clause in this tool by practice area and then by eye for the doc title, select which piece of content they want to reuse, copy the xml snippet which is generated in the tool and then paste it into their xml document. At the point of document publication, the xml reference they copied and pasted will convert to the actual snippet they desired.
